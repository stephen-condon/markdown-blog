# Climbing Stairs

I've recently been doing practice coding exercises on [CodeSignal](https://codesignal.com), so I thought it might be useful to post about working one of these problems. I usually can get to a brute force solution fairly quickly, but struggle optimizing an algorithm for speed. This is not always my fault - some of these leetcode exercises seem to revolve around tricks and memorizing common problems, which is silly, but let's treat these charitably.

```
You are climbing a staircase that has n steps. You can take the steps either 1 or 2 at a time. Calculate how many distinct ways you can climb to the top of the staircase.
```

Okay, for n steps, basically this means:
- 1 at a time: n steps
- 2 at a time: n/2 steps
- some combination of 1s and 2s: this feels like some kind of factorial/fibonacci combination

Some given tests:
- n: 1, solution: 1
- n: 2, solution: 2
- n: 26, solution: 196418
- n: 38, solution: 63245986
- n: 28, solution: 514229
- n: 13, solution: 377
- n: 4, solution: 5
- n: 17, solution: 2584
- n: 20, solution: 10946
- n: 42, solution: 433494437
- n: 23, solution: 46368

So, just based on some of those tests, brute forcing isn't going to have a prayer of solving it in the 4 seconds I'm given for Python3.

Let's think recursively, trying to prove out using some of the low n test cases. For n = 4, there should be 5 ways:
- 1, 1, 1, 1 = 4
- 2, 2 = 4
- 2, 1, 1 = 4
- 1, 2, 1 = 4
- 1, 1, 2 = 4

To give us n = 1 through 4, let's manually calculate n = 3, and add as a custom test:
- 1, 1, 1 = 3
- 2, 1 = 3
- 1, 2 = 3

And for a little more depth, n = 5:
- 1, 1, 1, 1, 1
- 2, 2, 1
- 1, 2, 2
- 2, 1, 2
- 2, 1, 1, 1
- 1, 2, 1, 1
- 1, 1, 2, 1
- 1, 1, 1, 2

So:

| n | solution |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 1 |
| 2 | 2 |
| 3 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 |
| 5 | 8 |

Let's look at the higher n values here. The solution for 5 = the sum of solutions for 3 & 4. The solution for 4 = the sum of solutions for 2 & 3. So, to generalize it, if we know n = 1 & n = 2:
```
f(n) = f(n - 1) + f(n - 2)
```

So we do a recursive calculation:
```
def solution(n):
    result = solution(n-1) + solution(n-2)
    tracker[n] = result
    return result
```

And then throw in our known values of n = 1 & n = 2:
```
def solution(n):
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return n

    result = solution(n-1) + solution(n-2)
    tracker[n] = result
    return result
```

Running most of the higher n values results in exceeding the time limit for code runs. So, let's try to create a data object to keep track of calculations so we only have to calculate each f(n) once rather than for every branch of the tree.

```
tracker = {}

def solution(n):
    # if we have it in the tracker dict, use that rather than calculating
    if n in tracker:
        return tracker[n]
    
    # if n is 1 or 2, use the known atomic values
    if n == 1 or n == 2:
        return n
    
    # if none of the above, let's do the recursive calc
    result = solution(n-1) + solution(n-2)
    tracker[n] = result
    return result
```

The basic tests all pass! It's time to submit the solution, and see if there are any edge cases I'm missing/not thinking through. It worked!
