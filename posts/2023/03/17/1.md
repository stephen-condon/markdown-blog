# Hello World

So I've decided to start a blog again, focused on learning something technical (right now Scala). We'll see if I can keep it up.

I've created this as a series of .md files in GitHub as the most basic possible blog format, and one that I am somewhat familiar with. No comments of course, but this might provide the basis for building a blog platform for fun as well.
